                    <h2>Running and Climbing </h2>




                    <p>
                        <b>Running</b> on softer surfaces like forest trails puts substantially less pressure on your joints, which in turn should mean fewer injuries stopping you from reaching race day. Taking your training off-road also requires a great deal more concentration and balance than running on tarmac, those added wobbles will help you build up all-important stabilising leg muscles, again aiding the prevention of injury.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Trail running is also a simple and proven way to improve your mental health and wellbeing. A study of the benefits of green exercise at the University of Essex showed improvements in mental wellbeing, social inclusion and connection to nature.

                        Rock <b>climbing</b>  are proven to have numerous health benefits
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        One of the great benefits of rock climbing is that it works both your upper and lower body muscles. You will strengthen muscles in your back and arms when pulling yourself up, and youâ€™ll be forced to engage the muscles of your core, quads, and calves to stabilize your body while climbing. Working all of these muscles in a single workout makes your time spent at the gym more effective, and it is a great solution for those who do not have time to come into the gym multiple times a week to work out different muscle groups separately.
