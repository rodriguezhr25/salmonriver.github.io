                    <h2>The Town.</h2>
                 <p>Riggins lies between the two deepest gorges in North America and rides the banks of the Little Salmon River and the famous Salmon River, the longest free-flowing river within the lower 48 states. Adventures east take you up the Salmon River to the “River of No Return” Wilderness, a name that the Indians used to warn Lewis and Clark; and also captured the spirit of Captain Guleke’s adventures in his one-way scow trips.
                </p>
                   <p> Turn west and adventures take you to the Snake River and Hells Canyon. This spectacular setting makes an ideal home base to explore areas of recreation, history, and scenic beauty.
